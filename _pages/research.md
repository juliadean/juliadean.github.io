### Socio-Computational Ecosystem of Immigrants
This work aims to understand the information and communication technology network of migrants in the United States, especially during their immigration and naturalization process, to understand how to design better technical ecosystems for societal newcomers. We are currently finishing up this work in progress - stay tuned!

### Positionality in HCI
 I am currently working with [Dylan Doyle-Burke](https://dylanthomasdoyle.com/) and [Dr. Bryan Semaan](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/information-science/bryan-semaan) on a qualitative analysis of positionality statements on papers published in primarily CHI and CSCW. We are hoping to establish more norms and establish patterns of how, when, and why authors write them.

["Tourism Gives an Image of the Mess": The Relation Between Tourism and Local Society in Maranhão, Brazil](https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/undergraduate_honors_theses/q811kk18d)

This research focused on how top-down governmental toruism policies impacted local culture and society on a rural population in Maranhão, Brazil. After conducting semi-structured interviews, I find that tourism has both negative and positive impacts on this society, and I offer policy recommendations to help better integrate and advocate for local culture.
