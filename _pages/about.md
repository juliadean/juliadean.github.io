About
======
Hello! My name is Julia Dean, and I am a second year PhD student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am co-advised by [Dr. Amy Voida](https://amy.voida.com/) and [Dr. Bryan Semaan](https://www.theadalab.com/). My research is focused on how organizations collaborate to support their clients, the role of digital identity to societal newcomers, accessible information gathering, and critical HCI. You can read about my current projects [here](https://juliaarthur3.github.io/research/).

Before starting at CU, I worked primarily at nonprofits and technology startups. My career included working with people with disabilities to find gainful employment, J-1 visa sponsorship to the United States, insurance technology, and creative tools. Prior to that, I received a dual undergraduate degree in International Affairs and Spanish/Portuguese. 

In my free time, you can find me [trail running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/25609538), playing rugby, gravel biking, or reading! Feel free to reach out about any of the topics above!

Graduate Application Assistance
======
As a second-career graduate student, I completely understand how difficult it is to feel confident applying to grad school at any stage of life, especially after time away. I would be happy to read/review materials, talk about careers or graduate life, or share my own materials!
