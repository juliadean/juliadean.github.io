### INFO 2131 - Information Ecosystems (Graduate Part-Time Instructor)

I am currently teaching a Monday/Wednesday class of over 50 students derived from the original INFO 2131 designed by Drs. Amy Voida and Leysia Palen. We explore perspectives on how to understand and analyze qualitative data, communicating modern-day examples of information and data challenges based on projects of their choosing. I prep and hold class, coordinate group projects and in class activities, and guide students through their major.
